# The Third Law

Imagine the classic game of Asteroids...but you can only move by shooting and you play as Isaac Newton??? ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”

Isaac Newton has had enough of these infuriating apples hitting his head! Throw math at the apples to destroy them! Watch out! Every action has an equal and opposite reaction!

## Other neat features
* Aim your shots with an intuitive drag system! You can control the throw power based on how far you drag!
* Increase or decrease your MASS with power-ups! Be careful, these power-ups might not be so helpful, don't lose control!
* Grab the invincibility power-up to get a shield!
* Go for the explosion power up to shoot off an explosion of math!
* Clear the apples to get to the next stage, where there will be more apples! It goes on forever!

## Internal cool stuff
* Complex power-up system that allows easy programming of power-ups
* Runs at a SOLID 60fps
* I had to learn trigonometry again to make this
